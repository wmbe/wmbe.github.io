#Who watches the watchers? We all do!
Camera surveilance has become ubiquitous. In (nude) saunas, on the street, at your school, work, city, village, ... we're being 👁️watched👁️ all the time.

This is merely a redirecting project to a citizen science project trying to detail where and how we are being watched. You can contribute to the project by simply signing up for an Open Street Maps account and adding your neighborhood camera's. Privacy is the 12th human right. It's a social good we can protect together.
